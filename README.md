Binance monitor and log program

I've just started with python and I'm trying to make a monitoring program of the buy and sell orders at binance. 

It should run in the background, popup notifications and write logs to a file.
I want to do this with websocket so it's real-time.

Which I'm running into right now:
Binance wants to get some ping so the stream stays up.
I haven't figured out how to do that yet.
I've already made a base so you can set a countdown to send a ping to binance every half hour.
Changed the countdown for testing.

Suggestions are welcome of course :-)
