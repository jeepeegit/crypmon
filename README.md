Binance monitor and log program

I've just started with python and I'm trying to make a monitoring program of the buy and sell orders at binance. 
So if I've programmed something really weird just smile hard and then help me in the right direction :-)


It should run in the background, popup notifications and write logs to a file.
I want to do this with websocket so it's real-time.


Suggestions are welcome of course :-)
